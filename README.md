# The SmartChatBot
## Your Friend who understands any document and answers your questions.



Sometimes we get tired of listening to blunt answers from a chatbot. It is here that the Smart bot comes to our rescue. I want to build a network which can answer about any given text, a web page, an article or even a book, anything you give it. Suppose one of our friends has already read a long article and has understood that, and now we want to start reading the same article, taking help from your friend and asking him to summarize the article would really help us to get started on the document and also get a feel of the document before you actually decide to read it. How about a question answering machine on Kindle books? Wouldnâ€™t it be wonderful when someone can answer any question you have on the book? This kind of expert system will boost our productivity and aid us immensely to master any topic. These are some of my motivations to build this network.
